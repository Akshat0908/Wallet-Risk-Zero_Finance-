## 1. Data Collection Method

### Multi-API Approach
The system employs a robust multi-API strategy to ensure comprehensive data collection:

#### **Etherscan API Integration**
- **Purpose**: Primary source for Compound V2/V3 event logs
- **Data Collected**: Supply, borrow, repay, withdraw, and liquidation events
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 requests/second to respect API constraints
- **Event Tracking**: 
  - `Mint(address,uint256,uint256)` - Supply events
  - `Redeem(address,uint256,uint256)` - Withdraw events
  - `Borrow(address,uint256,uint256,uint256)` - Borrow events
  - `RepayBorrow(address,address,uint256,uint256)` - Repay events
  - `LiquidateBorrow(address,address,uint256,address,uint256)` - Liquidation events

#### **Alchemy API Integration**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive transaction history and asset transfers
- **Data Collected**: All wallet transactions involving Compound protocols
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second
- **Features**: Metadata, block timestamps, transaction categorization

#### **The Graph API (Optional)**
- **Purpose**: Protocol-specific subgraph queries
- **Data Collected**: Advanced protocol metrics and historical data
- **Usage**: Supplementary data for enhanced analysis

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Wallet Address Validation**: Ethereum address format verification
2. **Transaction Filtering**: Compound protocol-specific transaction identification
3. **Event Parsing**: Structured extraction of relevant transaction data
4. **Data Normalization**: Standardized format for analysis
5. **Rate Limiting**: Respectful API usage with retry logic

## 2. Feature Selection Rationale

Seven key risk indicators were selected based on established DeFi risk management principles:

### **Primary Risk Indicators (High Weight)**

#### **1. Borrow-to-Supply Ratio (25% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Primary leverage indicator in lending protocols
- **Calculation**: `total_borrowed_usd / total_supplied_usd`
- **Risk Logic**: Higher ratios indicate increased leverage and liquidation risk
- **Justification**: Standard metric used by all major DeFi lending protocols

#### **2. Liquidation Count (20% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Direct historical risk event indicator
- **Calculation**: Count of liquidation events where wallet was borrower
- **Risk Logic**: Past liquidations strongly predict future risk
- **Justification**: Proven correlation with future liquidation probability

### **Behavioral Risk Indicators (Medium Weight)**

#### **3. Inactivity Days (15% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Recent activity suggests active risk management
- **Calculation**: Days since last Compound protocol interaction
- **Risk Logic**: Inactive wallets may have forgotten positions
- **Justification**: Inactivity correlates with poor risk management

#### **4. Repayment Frequency (15% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Behavioral indicator of responsible borrowing
- **Calculation**: Repayments per month of activity
- **Risk Logic**: Regular repayments indicate disciplined borrowing
- **Justification**: Strong predictor of future repayment behavior

### **Asset & Protocol Risk Indicators (Lower Weight)**

#### **5. Volatile Asset Usage (10% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Asset-specific risk exposure
- **Calculation**: Percentage of transactions involving volatile assets
- **Risk Logic**: Volatile assets increase liquidation probability
- **Justification**: Price volatility directly impacts health factors

#### **6. Protocol Version (10% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Technology maturity and safety features
- **Calculation**: Primary protocol version used (V2 vs V3)
- **Risk Logic**: Newer protocols have improved safety mechanisms
- **Justification**: V3 includes enhanced liquidation protection

#### **7. Collateral Factor (5% weight)**
- **Rationale**: Safety margin indicator
- **Calculation**: Average collateral factor of used assets
- **Risk Logic**: Higher factors provide better safety margins
- **Justification**: Determines liquidation thresholds

## 3. Scoring Method

### **Algorithm Overview**
The risk scoring system uses a weighted, component-based approach with normalization:

#### **Base Scoring Framework**
```python
Base Score = 500 (neutral starting point)
Component Scores = -100 to +100 per feature
Weighted Score = Σ(Component × Weight)
Final Score = Base Score + Weighted Score
Normalized Score = MinMax Scaling to 0-1000 range
```

#### **Component Scoring Logic**
Each feature contributes -100 to +100 points based on risk level:

- **Borrow-to-Supply Ratio**:
  - 0-0.3: +100 (very low risk)
  - 0.3-0.5: +50 (low risk)
  - 0.5-0.7: 0 (moderate risk)
  - 0.7-0.9: -50 (high risk)
  - >0.9: -100 (very high risk)

- **Liquidation Count**:
  - 0: +50 (no liquidations)
  - 1: -25 (one liquidation)
  - 2: -50 (two liquidations)
  - 3-5: -75 (multiple liquidations)
  - >5: -100 (many liquidations)

#### **Normalization Method**
- **MinMax Scaling**: Ensures consistent 0-1000 range
- **Formula**: `normalized_score = (score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score) × 1000`
- **Purpose**: Standardized output for easy interpretation

#### **Risk Categories**
- **800-1000**: Very Low Risk
- **600-799**: Low Risk
- **400-599**: Moderate Risk
- **200-399**: High Risk
- **0-199**: Very High Risk

## 4. Justification of Risk Indicators

### **Industry Standard Alignment**
All risk indicators align with established DeFi risk management practices:

#### **Leverage Metrics (Borrow-to-Supply Ratio)**
- **Industry Standard**: Used by Compound, Aave, and all major lending protocols
- **Academic Support**: Well-documented correlation with liquidation risk
- **Regulatory Recognition**: Standard metric in DeFi risk assessment

#### **Historical Risk Events (Liquidation Count)**
- **Behavioral Finance**: Past behavior predicts future behavior
- **Risk Management**: Historical events indicate risk tolerance
- **Statistical Validation**: Strong correlation with future liquidations

#### **Activity Patterns (Inactivity, Repayment Frequency)**
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Activity patterns indicate risk management discipline
- **Operational Risk**: Inactive positions may be forgotten
- **Credit Scoring**: Similar to traditional credit scoring models

#### **Asset Risk (Volatile Asset Usage)**
- **Market Risk**: Price volatility directly impacts health factors
- **Portfolio Theory**: Diversification and asset selection matter
- **Liquidation Risk**: Volatile assets have higher liquidation probability

#### **Protocol Safety (Version, Collateral Factor)**
- **Technology Risk**: Newer protocols have improved safety features
- **Collateral Management**: Higher factors provide safety margins
- **System Design**: Protocol architecture affects risk profiles

### **Scalability Considerations**
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new risk indicators
- **Configurable Weights**: Adjustable based on market conditions
- **API Abstraction**: Easy to integrate new data sources
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large wallet lists
- **Caching Support**: Reduces API calls and improves performance

### **Validation Approach**
- **Real Data Testing**: Validated against actual Compound protocol data
- **Risk Distribution**: Results show realistic risk distribution
- **Performance Metrics**: Efficient processing of 100+ wallets
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and retry logic
